# E-commerce Project

This repository contains the frontend code for an e-commerce project. Currently, the Gmail or email sending system integration is not implemented. However, I plan to enhance this project significantly in the future using frameworks like React or other technologies.

## Future Plans

- *Framework Upgrade:* I intend to rebuild this project using modern frameworks such as React to improve scalability, performance, and maintainability.
  
- *Email Integration:* Implementing a robust email sending system will be a priority in future updates to enhance communication functionalities.
- And any other functionality in future
